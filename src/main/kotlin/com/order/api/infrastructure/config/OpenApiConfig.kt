// This file was intentionally removed from the project.
// OpenAPI / Swagger configuration was deleted as part of the cleanup.
// If you want to re-enable runtime OpenAPI generation, re-add a configuration
// class under com.order.api.infrastructure.config and the `springdoc` dependency in pom.xml.
